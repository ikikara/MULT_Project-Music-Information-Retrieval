## Description:
This was the 2nd project developed for Multimedia subject @University of Coimbra, Informatics Engineering <br>
Consists in develop a program that works as a system of music information retrieval, with *librosa* we extract some features, metadata, etc of a group of musics.

#### Main Languages:

## Technologies used:
1. Python
    - [Version 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
2. Libraries
    - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
    - [Scipy](https://scipy.org/)
    - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
    - [Librosa](https://librosa.org/)
3. FFMPEG
    - [Last Version](https://ffmpeg.org/)

## To run this project:
[WARNING] Python 3.9, FFMPEG and the libraries refered must be installed <br>
You have one way to run this project:
1. Using Terminal
    - Download the folders "src" and "resources"
    - Put in a folder these 2 folders
    - Navigate to the folder created
    - And then execute the following command on terminal: 
        ```shellscript
        [your-disk]:[name-path]> python main.py
        ```

## Notes important to read:
   - If you want to change the directory of the resources change the variable *FILE_PATH* and *SAVE_PATH* (using the SAME name) on top of the code.
   - If you want to see prints of some steps change the respectively variables to true on top of the code.
   - The program can take a little minutes (especially if your PC is a potato).
   - These musics are from the following source: http://mir.dei.uc.pt/downloads.html
